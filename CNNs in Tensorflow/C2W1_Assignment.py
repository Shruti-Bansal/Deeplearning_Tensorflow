# # Week 1: Using CNN's with the Cats vs Dogs Dataset
# 
# Welcome to the 1st assignment of the course! This week, you will be using the famous `Cats vs Dogs` dataset to train a model that can classify images of dogs from images of cats. For this, you will create your own Convolutional Neural Network in Tensorflow and leverage Keras' image preprocessing utilities.
# 
# You will also create some helper functions to move the images around the filesystem so if you are not familiar with the `os` module be sure to take a look a the [docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html).
# 
# Let's get started!

# In[3]:

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator
from shutil import copyfile
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


# Download the dataset from its original source by running the cell below. 
# 
# Note that the `zip` file that contains the images is unzipped under the `/tmp` directory.

# In[4]:


# If the URL doesn't work, visit https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=54765
# And right click on the 'Download Manually' link to get a new URL to the dataset

# Note: This is a very large dataset and will take some time to download

get_ipython().system('wget --no-check-certificate     "https://download.microsoft.com/download/3/E/1/3E1C3F21-ECDB-4869-8368-6DEBA77B919F/kagglecatsanddogs_3367a.zip"     -O "/tmp/cats-and-dogs.zip"')

local_zip = '/tmp/cats-and-dogs.zip'
zip_ref   = zipfile.ZipFile(local_zip, 'r')
zip_ref.extractall('/tmp')
zip_ref.close()


# Now the images are stored within the `/tmp/PetImages` directory. There is a subdirectory for each class, so one for dogs and one for cats.

# In[5]:


source_path = '/tmp/PetImages'

source_path_dogs = os.path.join(source_path, 'Dog')
source_path_cats = os.path.join(source_path, 'Cat')


# os.listdir returns a list containing all files under the given path
print(f"There are {len(os.listdir(source_path_dogs))} images of dogs.")
print(f"There are {len(os.listdir(source_path_cats))} images of cats.")


# **Expected Output:**
# 
# ```
# There are 12501 images of dogs.
# There are 12501 images of cats.
# ```

# You will need a directory for cats-v-dogs, and subdirectories for training
# and testing. These in turn will need subdirectories for 'cats' and 'dogs'. To accomplish this, complete the `create_train_test_dirs` below:

# In[6]:


# Define root directory
root_dir = '/tmp/cats-v-dogs'

# Empty directory to prevent FileExistsError is the function is run several times
if os.path.exists(root_dir):
  shutil.rmtree(root_dir)

# GRADED FUNCTION: create_train_test_dirs
def create_train_test_dirs(root_path):
  ### START CODE HERE

  # HINT:
  # Use os.makedirs to create your directories with intermediate subdirectories

  train_dir = os.path.join(root_path, 'training')
  test_dir = os.path.join(root_path, 'testing')
  
  train_cats_dir = os.path.join(train_dir, 'cats')
  os.makedirs(train_cats_dir)
  train_dogs_dir = os.path.join(train_dir, 'dogs')
  os.makedirs(train_dogs_dir)

  test_cats_dir = os.path.join(test_dir, 'cats')
  os.makedirs(test_cats_dir)
  test_dogs_dir = os.path.join(test_dir, 'dogs')
  os.makedirs(test_dogs_dir)

  ### END CODE HERE

  
try:
  create_train_test_dirs(root_path=root_dir)
except FileExistsError:
  print("You should not be seeing this since the upper directory is removed beforehand")


# In[7]:


# Test your create_train_test_dirs function

for rootdir, dirs, files in os.walk(root_dir):
    for subdir in dirs:
        print(os.path.join(rootdir, subdir))


# **Expected Output (directory order might vary):**
# 
# ``` txt
# /tmp/cats-v-dogs/training
# /tmp/cats-v-dogs/testing
# /tmp/cats-v-dogs/training/cats
# /tmp/cats-v-dogs/training/dogs
# /tmp/cats-v-dogs/testing/cats
# /tmp/cats-v-dogs/testing/dogs
# 
# ```

# Code the `split_data` function which takes in the following arguments:
# - SOURCE: directory containing the files
# 
# - TRAINING: directory that a portion of the files will be copied to (will be used for training)
# - TESTING: directory that a portion of the files will be copied to (will be used for testing)
# - SPLIT SIZE: to determine the portion
# 
# The files should be randomized, so that the training set is a random sample of the files, and the test set is made up of the remaining files.
# 
# For example, if `SOURCE` is `PetImages/Cat`, and `SPLIT` SIZE is .9 then 90% of the images in `PetImages/Cat` will be copied to the `TRAINING` dir
# and 10% of the images will be copied to the `TESTING` dir.
# 
# All images should be checked before the copy, so if they have a zero file length, they will be omitted from the copying process. If this is the case then your function should print out a message such as `"filename is zero length, so ignoring."`. **You should perform this check before the split so that only non-zero images are considered when doing the actual split.**
# 
# 
# Hints:
# 
# - `os.listdir(DIRECTORY)` returns a list with the contents of that directory.
# 
# - `os.path.getsize(PATH)` returns the size of the file
# 
# - `copyfile(source, destination)` copies a file from source to destination
# 
# - `random.sample(list, len(list))` shuffles a list

# Now that you have successfully organized the data in a way that can be easily fed to Keras' `ImageDataGenerator`, it is time for you to code the generators that will yield batches of images, both for training and validation. For this, complete the `train_val_generators` function below.
# 
# Something important to note is that the images in this dataset come in a variety of resolutions. Luckily, the `flow_from_directory` method allows you to standarize this by defining a tuple called `target_size` that will be used to convert each image to this target resolution. **For this exercise, use a `target_size` of (150, 150)**.
# 
# **Note:** So far, you have seen the term `testing` being used a lot for referring to a subset of images within the dataset. In this exercise, all of the `testing` data is actually being used as `validation` data. This is not very important within the context of the task at hand but it is worth mentioning to avoid confusion.
